Input
• The first line of input contains two integers: first W , the width of the original slab, and then H,
the height of the original slab;
• The second line contains one integer N: the number of desired plate sizes. The following N lines
contain the desired plate sizes. Each of these lines contains two integers: first the width Wi and
then the height Hi of that desired plate size (1 ≤ i ≤ N).
Output
For each dataset, write in one line a single integer: the minimum total area of the original slab that must
be wasted.
