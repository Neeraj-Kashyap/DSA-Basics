Input

The input consists of several test cases.

Each test case starts with the number of inhabitants N (2 ≤ N ≤ 100000).

The following line contains n integers ai (-1000 ≤ ai ≤ 1000).

If ai ≥ 0, it means that the inhabitant living in the ith house wants to buy ai bottles of wine. If ai < 0, he wants to sell -ai bottles of wine.

You may assume that the numbers ai sum up to 0.

The last test case is followed by a line containing 0.
Output

For each test case print the minimum amount of work units needed so that every inhabitant has his demand fulfilled.
